# Personal configuration for Neovim
My personal setup for the Neovim text editor.

## Recommendations:
I recommend downloading a custom font from [NerdFonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads), installing it on your system, and using it in your terminal to enhance the icon theme experience, with <b>Mono</b> fonts recommended.
